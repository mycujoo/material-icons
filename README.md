# React Material Icons

React wrapper around Google's [Material Design Icons](material.io/icons/) with no external dependencies. üòç

## Usage

```
yarn add https://github.com/mycujoo/material-icons
```

and then

```
import { icon_share as IconShare } from 'material-icons/social'

<IconShare />
```

And done! üéâ

#### ES6

```
const IconsSocial = require('material-icons/social')
const Icon3dRotation = IconsSocial.icon_3d_rotation

// or
const Icon3dRotation = require('material-icons/social').icon_3d_rotation
```

### Format

All icons are prefixed with `icon_`.

```
import { icon_${name} as Icon } from 'material-icons/${category}'
```

### Finding the icon

Visit the [icon list](https://material.io/icons/) and import from the category the icon is in.

### Example

"3d rotation" icon in the "Action" category would be named `icon_3d_rotation` and would be imported from `'material-icons/action'`.

```
import { icon_3d_rotation as IconRotation } from 'material-icons/action'
```
